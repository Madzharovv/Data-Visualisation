Great topic for visualization and one I suspect that will produce results that should interest you.

Your generally well-specified research questions are sufficiently wide ranging to benefit from a visualization approach and expressed in such a way to provide design guidance when you move on to the implementation phase of your project. The best questions tend to focus on the knowledge and understanding you wish to gain that go beyond 'know the data' and prove genuinely helpful when making design choices. Perhaps there are some minor tweaks you could apply to your questions to ease that design choice process further?

You provide a justification for the visualization approach which demonstrates you are aware of some of the benefits of data visualization and how human-in-the-loop analysis and interpretation can be used to support the visualization design process. As a further check, ensure your justification is closely tied to your specific RQs so they go beyond general arguments for using data visualization and focus why in this context, datavis is likely to be effective.
