{(questions|}

- How has the game of basketball developed in the NBA over time?

- How has Stephen Curry influenced the game of basketall and is his influence as substantial as described by the media? 

- Is the three point shot worth too many points and if so why or why not?

{|questions)}

{(datasources|}

Stathead.com and Basketball-Refference.com are well known, very detailed, up to data websites with tons of data on different sports including basketball and specifically the NBA. I will be using these websites as the data source for my data visualisation as the data is tidy and because I have a membership with them I have complete access to all statistics related to basketball since game and players stats were recorded(1947).

_A couple of sentences on why you need datavis to answer your research questions._

I need data visualisation to answer these questions as it will allow me to put into perspective the gargantuan data surrounding the game of basketball.

Using data visualisation I will be able to absorb and understand a considerably large data using useful and adequate graphs and charts to represent it.

It will allow me to discover trends I wasn't aware of, notice new patterns, improve my overall relatively new insight of the game of basketball which I have recently become very interested in and passionate about. These visualisations will help me find out if there is any truth behind the narratives the sports media push and allow me to form personal educated opinions on the game of basketball in the NBA specifically.
